> Here i am!

A designer and web designer from Italy who knows about programming , graphic design and moar.

> Example

As an example of UI/UX i choose *ndm* for example - https://720kb.github.io/ndm/

I choose this project in order to show you everything about my capabilities in terms of Design and not only Ui/Ux.

> What i made

In this project i made all that catch your eyes, from the first pixel to logotype, user interface, app interface, all optimized for the web and for Desktop, every single pixel is designed by me both online and offline.

Project Ideation,
Logotype,
UI/UX of the web site and the Desktop APP,
Responsive Design.

I really suggest you to download the app and see how it interacts.

Probably not the best project i did in the past, but surely the one who makes me happy because it's appreciated a lot by the open source community.

> Why this design?

This project is a simple but powerfull tool that helps organize and maintain npm modules on your PC.
Was not that simple, i choosed a clean and funny Design and superlight interface in order to spread a simple message: Download a software and have fun.

> Interactions

I tipically ideate and prototype a design by hand on a paper.....design process for me is:

Create a structure, clean simple.
Choose the right font.
Add everything in the right place, make the mission/aim clear. 
Give dimension balances.
Make things optimized and responsive.
Give a touch of art and something that catch the eyes, without being intrusive for the user.
Finally optimize accessibility with all of the things that must be done (if needed).

> More design

You can find other projects i got involved in
Just... i have to say that the majority of the old projects are offline today.

I wanted to be clear and short at the end.

Is not simple for me to link you other projects as mostly are today replaced by owners, you know they change designers often during the years....

I love graphic design and design in general, i am completely sure i can be of help in any aspect of Design in general as well as graphic and user interfaces, then accessibility of course.

> More about me
