## Here i am!

A designer and web designer from Italy who knows about programming , graphic design and moar.

## Example

As an example of UI/UX i choose *ndm* for example - https://720kb.github.io/ndm/

I choose this project in order to show you everything about my capabilities in terms of Design and not only Ui/Ux.

## What i made

In this project i made all that catch your eyes,from the first pixel to logotype, user interface, app interface all optimized for the web and for Desktop, icons everything you see there is designed by me: 

Project Ideation,
Logotype,
UI/UX of the web site and the Desktop APP,
Responsive Design, all made using a framework.

I really suggest you to download the app and see how it interacts.

## More design
Here https://dribbble.com/45kb are other projects i got involved in but i have to say majority of the old projects are offline today.

I wanted to be clear and short at the end.

Is not simple for me to link you other projects as mostly are today replaced by owners, you know they change designers often during the years....

I love graphic design and design in general, i am completely sure i can be of help in any aspect of Design in general as well as graphic and user interfaces, then accessibility of course.

## More about me
I come from Italy, Follonica, place of music, sea, sun, colors.

## :) Thanks
