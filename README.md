**HELLO :)**
i am going to show you something i have done about user interface and graphic design in general.

Checkout - ndm project - for example - https://720kb.github.io/ndm/

In this project i made all you see, from the first pixel, logotype, user interface, app interface all optimized, icons everything you see there is designed by me.  i Suggest to download the app and see how it interacts.

Here https://dribbble.com/45kb are other projects i got involved in but mostly are offline today, mostly web apps and music platforms i did ui/ux and frontend design both.

Is not simple to link you other projects as mostly are today replaced by owners they change designers often during the years....

A BIG THANK YOU!
