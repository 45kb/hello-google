### Hi!
A designer and frontend maker from Italy who knows about programming and moar.

As an example of UI/UX i choose *ndm* for example - https://720kb.github.io/ndm/

I choose this in order to show everything about my capabilities in terms of Design not only ui/ux.

In this project i made all you see, from the first pixel to logotype, user interface, app interface all optimized for the web and for Desktop, icons everything you see there is designed by me:

Project Ideation,
Logotype,
UI/UX of the web site and the Desktop APP,
Responsive Design, all made using a framework.

I really suggest to download the app and see how it interacts.

Here https://dribbble.com/45kb are other projects i got involved in but mostly are offline today, mostly web apps and music platforms where i did the ui/ux and frontend design both.

I wanted to be clear and short.

Is not simple for me to link you other projects as mostly are today replaced by owners, you know they change designers often during the years....

I am not a fan of Rosemary design i have to say i like more flat clean and simple design in general.

A BIG THANK YOU FOR THIS CHANCHE!
